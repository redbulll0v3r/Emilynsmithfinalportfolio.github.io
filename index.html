<h3> Photo Manipulation - Cryptids </h3>
<p> <b> Project Two </b> <br> <b> Goal: </b> Create a cryptid using Photoshop to combine five or more images into one composite image. Keep in mind where this creature lives, how it came to be, as well as the visual and compositional elements of the piece.  </p>
<p> <b> Project Two </b> <br> <b> My Project: </b> I decided to piece together a small bird, with eagle legs and branches on is back to help help it blend into its surroundings. This bird makes baby crying noises to attract its prey then uses the eagle talons to latch on and devour.

<h3>  Interactive Projection - Hearing Protection </h3>
<p> <b> Project Four </b> <br> <b> Goal: </b> Use Arduino boards to code a projection to work interactively with an audience. </p>
<p> <b> Project Four </b> <br> <b> My Project: </b> I decided to use my major of ASL Interpreting to my advantage to push the concept of protecting one's hearing. I created four different videos, ranging from nice and cheerful, to dark and eerie. I used a microphone to connect these videos to the decibel level in the room - the louder the room got the spookier the video got.
